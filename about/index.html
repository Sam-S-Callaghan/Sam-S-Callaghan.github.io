<h1> About Me </h1>


<img src="../img/my-picture.png" style="width: auto; height: auto;max-width: 300px;max-height: 300px">

<p> I am a two time pulitzer prize winning journalist trying to tell the truth to the people of my dear city new york. My <br>
    dedication to this desire has gotten me fired from 6 Jobs but I won't let that stop me. <br> <br> I am also legally required 
  to tell you that I am not allowed within 500ft of Peter Parker.</p>
