The new Spiderman is way too cringey. Yes, I know that Peter Parker was always kinda nerdy, but MCU Peter Parker is too over the top with 
the forced nerd references every time he appears. Yea, we get it, you're a nerd, now stop with the Star Wars and Alien references.

Also, Spiderman was kinda meant to be more of a working class superhero. The new version of Spiderman is hanging out with literal 
billionaires and everything comes easy to him. It just doesn't suit his character.
