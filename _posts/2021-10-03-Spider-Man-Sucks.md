Dear readers, we are now accepting fan mail. If you meet my standards you may get published online, much like the lucky man below.
This is what our dear reader has to say:

_The new Spiderman is way too cringey. Yes, I know that Peter Parker was always kinda nerdy, but MCU Peter Parker is too over the top with 
the forced nerd references every time he appears. Yea, we get it, you're a nerd, now stop with the Star Wars and Alien references._

_Also, Spiderman was kinda meant to be more of a working class superhero. The new version of Spiderman is hanging out with literal 
billionaires and everything comes easy to him. It just doesn't suit his character._


Now reader, I understand what you're saying, the Mask Menance does indeed not live up to acclaimed expectations. 
However, your reasoning still misses a cruical detail, spider man has __never__ been a hero of the proletariat.

# HE IS A HERO OF THE BIRDS. STAY VIGILANT.
